# anime-girls-with-book-api

Small API that scrapes https://github.com/cat-milk/Anime-Girls-Holding-Programming-Books repository and serves it.

Using the /images routes will give back the paginated data. When the page is not submitted it returns the first page.

/categories route gives back all the categories with the name, link, and imageCount to show on the front end.

The current API version is built to support my front end.
